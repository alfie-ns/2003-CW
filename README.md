## Start-up Idea

**Casino Simulator** is a semi open-world simulation game where the user starts with an empty casino and a small amount of cash. The player can:

- [ ] Choose what games to play from a selection of slot machines, blackjack, craps, roulette, and pachinko.
- [ ] Make money from NPCs playing on these machines.
- [ ] Gamble the money they make on the casino games to either increase or lose their money.
- [ ] Choose where to place machines and which machines to add.

The player's goal is to gain more money and expand the size of the casino. There will be no story mode, but a small tutorial will be included to guide players. The game will be rated **18+** due to its gambling elements.

## Development Focus

- **Morgan McGovern & Harrison Buck**: Focus on the main game development and mechanics.
- **Alfie Nurse**: Focus on AI and algorithm development to control NPC behaviour and game mechanics.

## Development Notes

- When you use the pu.sh script, you can just do `./git/pu.sh` in the root directory
- The pu.sh script automatically pulls latest changes from main branch before pushing local changes
- There's also a push.bat script; just run 'push' in git/

## DANGEROUS COMMANDS

- `git reset --hard HEAD`
- `git clean -f -d`
