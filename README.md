## Start-up Idea

**Casino Simulator** is a free-roam casino simulation game where the user starts with an empty casino and a small amount of cash. The player can:

- [X] Choose what games to play from a selection of slot machines, blackjack, roulette.
- [X] Make money from playing on machines.
- [X] Gamble the money they make on the casino games to either increase or lose their money.
- [X] Choose where to place machines and which machines to add.

The player interacts with any game; Roulette, Blackjack, or Slot Machines. 

## Development Focus

- Morgan McGovern & Harrison Buck: Focus on the main game development and mechanics.
- Alfie Nurse: Focus on the Django API and secure OpenAI integration, configuration of ApiManager and other game scripts to work with the API.

## Development Notes

- When you use the pu.sh script, you can just do `./git/pu.sh` in the root directory
- The pu.sh script automatically pulls latest changes from main branch before pushing local changes
- There's also a push.bat script; just run 'push' in git/

## DANGEROUS COMMANDS

- `git reset --hard HEAD`
- `git clean -f -d`
