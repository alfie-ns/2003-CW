# Casino Simulator: AI Systems Design

## Smart Dealers with Difficulty Levels & Personality

### AI Difficulty Levels

Three distinct difficulty tiers for dealer AI:

#### Easy Dealer

- Uses basic strategies only
- No adaptive behaviour
- Suitable for new players
- Predictable betting patterns

#### Intermediate Dealer

- Tracks player's previous moves
- Adapts strategies during gameplay
- Occasional calculated risks
- Basic pattern recognition

#### Hard Dealer

- Complex strategy implementation
- Advanced pattern recognition
- Simulated card counting abilities
- Dynamic risk assessment

### Dealer Personality Profiles

Each dealer implements unique behavioural patterns:

#### Aggressive Dealer

- High-risk betting strategies
- Frequent bluffing
- Pushes players towards larger bets
- Quick decision making

#### Conservative Dealer

- Risk-averse behaviour
- Methodical play style
- Focuses on steady, small gains
- Defensive strategy against large bets

#### Chaotic Dealer

- Unpredictable betting patterns
- Mixed strategy implementation
- Random behavioural shifts
- Designed to challenge pattern recognition

## Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment

### Implementation Factors

System adjusts difficulty based on:

- Win/loss ratio tracking
- Betting pattern analysis
- Risk-taking behaviour monitoring
- Real-time performance metrics

### Adjustment Triggers

- Consistent player wins/losses
- Significant bankroll changes
- Playing time duration
- Bet size variations

## Fraud Detection Systems

### Monitoring Systems

Automated detection of:

- Unusual betting patterns
- Statistical anomalies
- Time-based irregularities
- Player behaviour patterns

### Detection Parameters

System flags:

- Repetitive betting sequences
- Unusual win/loss patterns
- Non-human response times
- Statistical improbabilities

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Core Systems

- Pattern recognition algorithms
- Behavioural tracking systems
- Statistical analysis tools
- Real-time monitoring solutions

### Development Considerations

- Modular system design
- Scalable difficulty parameters
- Performance optimisation
- Testing framework requirements
